- 👋 Hi, I’m @taylorbranson17
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, front-end web development, and creating things that Inspire People.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my Associate's Degree in Computer Programming and Application Development, due to be complete in Spring 2024. 
   It's given me a greater depth of knowledge (so far) in Python, HTML/CSS, JS, and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects:) I love collaborating, and am passionate about what I do.
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn - @taylorbranson17 or taylorbranson2000@gmail.com
